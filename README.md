# Hometown Project
Introduction
This is a Scrimba solo project. It encourages learners to create a website about their hometown.
It includes personalised photographs and things of interest that the learner may wish to include.

Motivation
My motivation for this project is to learn how to create a website. I would like to make it responsive
which I will try once I learn more about responsive layouts.

Acknowledgements
I want to thank Scrimba for making it possible to learn how to do this and I want to thank
Juvenile Napuu for providing the layout for this project.
